This thesis aims to explore machine learning techniques and options to process time signals with focus on ECG. The thesis explores impact of modifications of Fourier tranform on performace of machine learning models and will compare the accuracy of models in frequency domain with individual modifications to models working in time domain.

Individual steps:
1) Review machine learning models for time signal classification (partial and whole) and techniques for preprocessing time signals.
2) Describe and explore suitable dataset. For ex-ample CODE-15 for ECG Classification.
3) Review Fourier transform, it’s modifications and propose your modifications.
4) Create a baseline model and experiment with modified models and document the impact of modifications on accuracy of the model.
6) Compare the results with techniques directly using the time domain data.
